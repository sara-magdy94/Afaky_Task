I used POM (page object model) pattern, 
Test reporting feature (extent reports and TestNG ),
java faker for different user data (randomly generated).
The test is doing the following steps:
o Open the website.
o Signup and send all registration test data
o After complete signup, assert on success msg shown and print out it
o Sign out from the website
o log out 
o Sign In
o Logout Again 
o assert on current url and page title
